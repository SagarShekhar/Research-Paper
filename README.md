# Research-Paper
This research paper explores the Active Directory (AD) structure, its core services, authentication mechanisms, and the protocols it utilizes. It also examines common attacks targeting AD environments, such as LLMNR poisoning, SMB relay attacks, Kerberoasting, and Golden Ticket attacks, along with their respective mitigation strategies. 

Additionally, the paper includes a live demonstration of these attacks. For this, we set up a dedicated AD lab consisting of one domain controller (DC) and two host machines, using Kali Linux for attack simulations. We leverage various open-source tools, including Responder, Impacket, Mimikatz, and NTLMRelayX, to conduct and analyze these attacks.
